Version 4.4.1
===============
- **Fix default redirect uri for ADAL on UWP**. When using a null RedirectURI, you typically got an error. However on UWP, this is an indication that the Windows Auth Broker (WEB) will be used. [ADAL issue #1400](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/issues/1400)
- **Fix for a race condition and a crash in ADAL when using PromptBehavior = Hidden** (which is only available on some windows platforms). [ADAL issue](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/commit/663ffeb8554ac6f6feab5cf0d2550ab99f7e2556)
- **GetAccountsAsync() can now be called when the device / computer is offline**. It was making an network call to the instance discovery endpoint to determine the environments (equivalent clouds base URLs) for caching, which meant GetAccountsAsync() did not work off-line. This has been fixed and GetAccountsAsync() is not dependent on a network call and works off-line. [MSAL issue #630](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues/630)

Version 4.4.0
===============
-Improvements and fixes to the token cache
- The serialized token cache can now be shared by different applications, therefore providing SSO if the same user signs-in in both applications
  - See [PR](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/pull/1365) and [MSAL Issue #653](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues/654)
- On .NET Core, the Token cache was shared by all instances of applications in memory. This is now fixed (See MSAL.NET issue #656 and [PR](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/pull/1360))
- Fixes consistency issues for advanced token cache migration scenarios from ADAL v3.x to ADA v4.x to MSAL v2.x 
  - [MSAL Issue #652](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues/652)
  - [MSAL Issue #651](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues/651)
- Cache lookups were optimized. Work done in conjunction with ADAL.iOS and MSAL.iOS native) [PR](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/pull/1350)
- The ExtraQueryParameter environment variable is now read on ADAL for the .NET Core platform, as was already the case in the .NET Framework case [ADAL issue #1362](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/issues/1362)
- A Client credential API which should not be used on Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android and UWP is now marked as obsolete 
  - [PR](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/pull/1375)

Version 4.3.0
===============
This release includes:
- Fix for cross-thread exception when setting the ownerWindow in PlatformParameters [ADAL issue #1277](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet)
- Ensure error codes are public [MSAL issue](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues/638)
- Device code flow enabled for ADFS

Version 4.2.0-preview
===============
This release includes:
- Due to static initialization, there was a race condition which appeared randomly. [MSAL issue #629](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues/629)
- Improved error messages and inclusion of an [aka.ms link]( https://aka.ms/adal-net-broker-redirect-uri-android) for broker redirect error. [ADAL issue #601](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues/601)
- For iOS, a clear exception message is now returned when the application is not able to access keychain, with instructions. See https://aka.ms/msal-net-enable-keychain-access for details. [MSAL issue #611](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues/611)
- For iOS, TeamId is now accessible when the device is locked. [MSAL issue #626](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues/626)
- For iOS, MSAL returns a useful error message, and an [aka.ms link](https://aka.ms/msal-net-enable-keychain-groups), when keychain access groups have not been set in the Entitlements.plist. [MSAL issue #633](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues/633)
- UWP cache fix. The key of the storage on UWP should be 255 characters or less. When using several scopes the key could exceed 255 characters. Now hashing scopes and environment on UWP.  [612](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues/612)
- Removal of double-logging in log files and callbacks.  https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/pull/1289

Version 4.1.0-preview
===============
This release includes: 

- Integrated Windows Auth and Username / Password minor changes, such as improved error messages and http call resilience

Version 4.0.0-preview
==============
This release includes:
- Support MonoAndroid8.1 and Uap10.0 (Windows 10 applications)
- Remove support for Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8, as well as Portable-net45+win (PCL)
- Remove `Microsoft.Identity.Models.Clients.ActiveDirectory.Platform.dll` which only contained type forwarding to be binary compatible
- To preserve the single-sign-on (SSO) state, the new versions of ADAL(v4) and MSAL(v2) share the same token cache, are capable of reading the ADAL 3.x token cache 
   and are capable of writing the ADAL 3.x token cache in addition to the new cache format (named unified cache), see https://aka.ms/adal-net-to-msal-net.
   Note that on mobile platforms (UWP, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android), you will benefit automatically from the token cache sharing between ADAL and MSAL as the library handles the serialization
   to the container of choice of the platform (respectively isolated storage, iOS key chain, and Android shared preferences).
- In the Xamarin.iOS platform, AuthenticationContext has a new property named KeychainSecurityGroup. This Xamarin iOS specific property enables you to direct the application to share the 
   token cache with other applications sharing the same keychain security group. If you provide this key, you must add the capability to your Application Entitlement. 
   For more info, see https://aka.ms/adal-net-sharing-cache-on-ios. This API may change in a future release.
