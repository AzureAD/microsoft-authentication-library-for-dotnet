# Overview

Bearer tokens are vulnerable to theft. Proof-of-Possession (PoP) tokens mitigate this by binding tokens to a specific client certificate. mTLS PoP tokens enhance this security by using mutual TLS (mTLS) to ensure the token is tied to the certificate used for authentication.

![Diagram outlining the mTLS PoP flow](../media/mtls_pop.png)

## Key Points

- mTLS PoP tokens are compliant with [RFC 8705](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705).
- Tokens are bound to certificates used in mTLS connections with both the ESTS and the resource server.

## SNI Certificate Scenario

[Subject Name Issuer (SNI)](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-usage-billing/howto/emission-setup/sdk-auth-sni) certificates are issued by MSFT trusted certificate authorities ([OneCert](https://eng.ms/docs/products/onecert-certificates-key-vault-and-dsms/onecert-customer-guide/onecert/docs)) and provide a secure way to bind tokens to certificates. This method requires setting the `sendX5C` property when using MSAL.

## Token Flow

### Certificate Acquisition

1. The client sends an SNI certificate associated with a 1P application in the token request (cert C).
2. The certificate is used to establish mTLS with ESTS.

### Token Binding

1. ESTS uses the mTLS certificate also as the authentication certificate.
2. A token bound to cert C is issued by ESTS.

### API Call with Bound Token

- The client makes a call to the resource server using the token over mTLS with cert C.

## MSAL Design Details for SNI

### New API Additions

#### `WithMtlsProofOfPossession()` at CCA request level

- Adds support for mTLS PoP tokens and uses the certificate from the CCA application level `.WithCertificate(certificate, true)`.
- Token type will be `mtls_pop`.
- Grant Type will be `ClientCredentials`.
- Request **should not** contain `client_assertion_type` or `client_assertion`.

### MTLS Endpoint Usage

The mTLS PoP flow relies on tenanted endpoints with support for regional configurations. The behavior varies based on the cloud environment:

#### Public Cloud

The base endpoint for public clouds is:

`https://{region}.mtlsauth.microsoft.com/{tenant_id}`

Example: Specifying the `westus` region results in:

`https://eastus.mtlsauth.microsoft.com/{tenant_id}`

#### Sovereign Clouds

For sovereign clouds, the base endpoint is adjusted for the cloud-specific environment. For instance:

- Azure Government: `https://{region}.mtlsauth.microsoftonline.us/{tenant_id}`
- Azure China: `https://{region}.mtlsauth.partner.microsoftonline.cn/{tenant_id}`

#### DSTS Cloud

DSTS does not use regions. The standard DSTS endpoint format is:

Azure DSTS: https://dsts.core.azure-test.net/{tenant_id}

#### Non-Standard Clouds

For non-standard clouds, the endpoint is formed by adding `{region}.mtlsauth` to the authority URL

Note: In MSAL .NET, this functionality is implemented in the [RegionAndMtlsDiscoveryProvider class](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/main/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/Instance/Discovery/RegionAndMtlsDiscoveryProvider.cs). Developers can refer to its unit [tests](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/eb39be7b002b38d7c2885078c4e506160014e458/tests/Microsoft.Identity.Test.Unit/PublicApiTests/MtlsPopTests.cs#L556) to gain further clarity on the logic and expected behavior.

Note: App developers create an MSAL Confidential Client Application (CCA) object with a certificate, which is used both to authenticate the app and to initiate the HTTP mTLS connection to the regional ESTS endpoint. ESTS validates the certificate during the mTLS handshake and also uses it as the authentication certificate to issue the token.

#### Sample usage in MSAL .NET

```csharp
string clientId = "163ffef9-a313-45b4-ab2f-c7e2f5e0e23e";
string authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/bea21ebe-8b64-4d06-9f6d-6a889b120a7c";
string[] scopes = new string[] { "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default" };

X509Certificate2 certificate = GetCertificateFromStore("Use The Lab Auth Cert");

IConfidentialClientApplication app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .WithAuthority(authority)
    .WithAzureRegion("westus")
    .WithCertificate(certificate, true)
    .WithExperimentalFeatures(true)
    .Build();

AuthenticationResult result = await app.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes).WithMtlsProofOfPossession()
    .WithExtraQueryParameters("dc=ESTSR-PUB-WUS3-AZ1-TEST1&slice=TestSlice") //Feature in test slice 
    .WithSendX5C(true)
    .ExecuteAsync();
```

## Tests to Validate mTLS PoP Tokens

### Certificate Validation Tests

- Verify that `MsalClientException` is thrown when no certificate is provided.
- Ensure that the correct exception message (`MsalErrorMessage.MtlsCertificateNotProvidedMessage`) is returned.
- Ensure that the certificate has a private key when used in the `WithCertificate()` method.
- Ensure X5C is sent along with the certificate. 

### Authority Tests

- Test with a valid tenanted authority URL (e.g., `https://login.microsoftonline.com/tenant_id`).
- Ensure an exception (`MsalError.MissingTenantedAuthority`) is thrown for `/common` or `/organizations` authority usage.
- Flow is applicable only to AAD and DSTS authorities. Verify that unsupported authority types (e.g., B2C) throw `MsalError.InvalidAuthorityType`.

### Region Validation Tests

- Ensure `MsalClientException` is thrown when no region is set and `WithMtlsProofOfPossession()` is called.
- Validate successful token acquisition with a specified region.
- Test auto-detected region functionality and confirm the expected region is used.
- Region is not required if the authority is DSTS.

### Grant Type Validation

- Ensure the grant type is `ClientCredentials`.
- Do not include `client_assertion` or `client_assertion_type` parameters in the request.

### Token Acquisition Tests

- Ensure tokens are bound to the specified certificate and the token type is `mtls_pop`.
- Test caching behavior: validate that a token is retrieved from the cache on subsequent requests.

### Integration Tests

- Get token from ESTS using an mTLS certificate.
- Simulate calls to the resource server using mTLS and verify successful authentication. *(No resource support yet.)*
- Test telemetry data: validate that both client-side and server-side metrics are captured.

**Integration test should include:**

- User sets authority to `login.microsoftonline.com/tid` and `validateAuthority=true`.
- Specifies region `X`.
- Uses mTLS authentication.

Expected behavior:

1. MSAL validates the original authority.
2. MSAL calls the token endpoint on `mtlsauth.X.login.microsoft.com/tid/`.

## Note for Developers

When implementing this feature, ensure both client-side and server-side telemetry are captured for the new token type (`mtls_pop`). Telemetry should include:

- Token acquisition success and failure metrics.
- Certificate usage in the Client Credentials flow.
- Regional endpoint usage.

This telemetry will aid in diagnosing issues and optimizing performance.
