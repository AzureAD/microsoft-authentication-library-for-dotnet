# MSAL MSI V2 /credential Endpoint Design Document

## Overview

This document provides detailed guidance for SDK developers to implement MSI V2 `/credential` endpoint support. It focuses on the **token acquisition process**, ensuring seamless interactions with Managed Identity Resource Providers (MIRPs) on **Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) and Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)**.

## Goals

The primary objective is to enable seamless token acquisition in MSI V2 for VM/VMSS, utilizing the `/credential` endpoint.

- Define the **MSI V2 token acquisition process**.
- Describe how MSAL interacts with the `/credential` and the ESTS regional token endpoint.
- Ensure compatibility with **Windows and Linux** VMs and VMSS.

## Token Acquisition Process

In **MSI V1**, IMDS or any other Managed Identity Resource Provider (MIRP) directly returns an **access token**. However, in **MSI V2**, the process involves two steps:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Application
    participant MSAL
    participant IMDS
    participant ESTS

    Application ->> MSAL: 1. Request token using Managed Identity
    MSAL ->> IMDS: 2. Probe for `/credential` endpoint availability
    IMDS -->> MSAL: 3. Response (200 OK / 404 Not Found)

    alt `/credential` endpoint available
        MSAL ->> IMDS: 4. Request Short-Lived Credential (SLC) via `/credential`
        IMDS -->> MSAL: 5. Return SLC
        MSAL ->> ESTS: 6. Exchange SLC for Access Token via MTLS
        ESTS -->> MSAL: 7. Return Access Token
        MSAL ->> Application: 8. Return Access Token
    else `/credential` endpoint not available
        MSAL ->> IMDS: 4a. Fallback to legacy `/token` endpoint
        IMDS -->> MSAL: 5a. Return Access Token
        MSAL ->> Application: 6a. Return Access Token
    end
```

### Short-Lived Credential Retrieval from `/credential` Endpoint

- Azure Managed Identity Resource Providers host the `/credential` endpoint.
- The client (MSAL) calls the `/credential` endpoint to retrieve a **short-lived credential (SLC)**.
- This credential is valid for a short duration and must be used promptly in the next step.

### Access Token Acquisition via ESTS

- The client presents the **short-lived credential** to **ESTS** over **MTLS** as an assertion.
- ESTS validates the credential and issues an **access token**.
- The access token is then used to authenticate with Azure services.

## Certificate Handling

To start the flow, MSAL requires a certificate. MSAL follows these steps:

1. **Check for an existing certificate (Windows only)**: MSAL looks for a platform certificate (`devicecert.mtlsauth.local`) in the given Azure resource (In both local machine and local user store). 
2. **Create a new certificate, if none is found**: If a platform certificate is not available, MSAL generates one (self signed) for authentication.
3. **Linux Only**: MSAL will always generate a self signed certificate on Linux.

## Source Detection Logic

MSAL follows a source detection process to determine how to interact with MSI endpoints and acquire tokens.

### Environment Variable Check

MSAL checks for Azure resource type based on specific environment variables to determine if the application is running on:

- **Service Fabric**
- **App Service**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Cloud Shell**
- **Azure Arc**

If identified, MSAL will use the appropriate legacy MSI endpoint for that resource.

### Fallback to IMDS

- If no specific Azure resource is identified from the environment variables, MSAL will fall back to IMDS (VMs and VMSS).
- This fallback is the MSI v1 design or the legacy fallback mechanism.
- In this new MSI v2 design, Before fully falling back to IMDS, MSAL will now **probe for the Credential Endpoint**.
- MSAL probes to see if the `/credential` endpoint exists.
- If the `/credential` endpoint is unavailable, it falls back to the legacy `/token` endpoint.
- If probe is succesful then we can assume the current Azure Resource is a VM/VMSS 

## MSI V2 /credential Endpoint Details

### Short-Lived Credential Retrieval

- The `/credential` endpoint provides a **temporary credential** instead of an access token.
- This credential is only valid for a short duration (1 hour) and must be used **immediately** to acquire an access token from ESTS.
- This mechanism improves security by reducing the lifetime of sensitive authentication materials.

### Retry Logic

MSAL uses the **default Managed Identity [retry](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/651b71c7d1dcaf3261e598e01e017dfd3672bb25/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/Http/HttpManagerFactory.cs#L28) policy** for MSI V2 credential/token requests, whether calling the ESTS endpoint or the new `/credential` endpoint. i.e. MSAL performs 3 retries with a 1 second pause between each retry. Retries are performed on certain error [codes](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/651b71c7d1dcaf3261e598e01e017dfd3672bb25/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/Http/HttpRetryCondition.cs#L12) only.

## Steps for MSI V2 Authentication

This section outlines the necessary steps to acquire an access token using the MSI V2 `/credential` endpoint. 

### 1. Check for an Existing (Platform) Certificate (Windows only)
- Search for a specific certificate (`devicecert.mtlsauth.local`) in `(Cert:\LocalMachine\My)`.
- If the certificate is not found in Local Machine, check Current User's certificate store `(Cert:\CurrentUser\My)`.

### 2. Generate a New Certificate (if platform certificate is not found)
- If no valid platform certificate is found in Cert:\LocalMachine\My or Cert:\CurrentUser\My, create a new in-memory self-signed certificate.
- This applies especially to Linux VMs, where platform certificates are not pre-configured, and MSAL must always generate an in-memory certificate for MTLS authentication.

#### Certificate Creation Requirements
- **Subject Name:** CN=mtls-auth (subject name not final).
- **Validity Period:** 90 days.
- **Key Export Policy:** Private key must be exportable to allow use for MTLS authentication.
- **Key Usage must include:** Digital Signature, Key Encipherment and TLS Client Authentication.
- **Storage:** The certificate should exist only in memory. It is not stored in the certificate store. It is discarded when the process exits.

#### Certificate Rotation Strategy
- **Track Expiry:** The expiration of the certificate must be monitored at runtime.
- **Rotation Trigger:** 5 days before expiry, generate a new in-memory certificate.

### 3. Extract Certificate Data
- Convert the certificate to a Base64-encoded string (`x5c`).
- Format the JSON payload containing the certificate details for request authentication.

### 4. Request MSI Credential
- Send a POST request to the IMDS `/credential` endpoint with the certificate details.
- The request must include:
  - `Metadata: true` header.
  - `X-ms-Client-Request-id` header with a GUID.
  - JSON body containing the certificate's public key in `jwk` format. [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7517#appendix-B) 
- Parse the response to extract:
  - `regional_token_url`
  - `tenant_id`
  - `client_id`
  - `credential` (short-lived credential).

### 5. Request Access Token from ESTS
- Construct the OAuth2 request body, including:
  - `grant_type=client_credentials`
  - `scope=https://management.azure.com/.default`
  - `client_id` from the MSI response.
  - `client_assertion` containing the short-lived credential.
  - `client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`.
- Send a POST request to the `regional_token_url` with the certificate for mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.

### 6. Retrieve and Use Access Token
- Parse the response to extract the `access_token`.
- Use the access token to authenticate requests to Azure services.
- Handle any errors that may occur during the token request.

| API Name                         | Purpose                                                                            |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GetBindingCertificate()`        | Helper method to get the binding certificate when a credential endpoint exist.     |
| `GetManagedIdentitySourceAsync()`| Helper method to get the managed identity source.                                  |
| `WithCorrelationID(GUID id)`     | Sets the correlation id for the managed identity requests (v2 source only)         |    

## Client-Side Telemetry

To improve observability and diagnostics of Managed Identity (MSI) scenarios within MSAL, we propose introducing a **new telemetry counter** named `MsalMsiCounter`. This counter will be incremented (or otherwise recorded) whenever MSI token acquisition activities occur, capturing the most relevant context in the form of tags.

### Counter Name
- **`MsalMsiCounter`**

### Tags
Each time we increment `MsalMsiCounter`, we include the following tags:

1. **MsiSource**  
   Describes which MSI path or resource is used.  
   - Possible values: `"AppService"`, `"CloudShell"`, `"AzureArc"`, `"ImdsV1"`, `"ImdsV2"`, `"ServiceFabric"`

2. **TokenType**  
   Specifies the type of token being requested or used.  
   - Possible values: `"Bearer"`, `"POP"`, `"mtls_pop"`

3. **bypassCache**  
   Indicates whether the MSAL cache was intentionally bypassed.  
   - Possible values: `"true"`, `"false"`

4. **CertType**  
   Identifies which certificate was used during the MSI V2 flow.  
   - Possible values: `"Platform"`, `"inMemory"`, `"UserProvided"`

5. **CredentialOutcome**  
   If using the `/credential` endpoint (ImdsV2) log the outcome.  
   - Not found
   - Retry Failed
   - Retry Succeeded
   - Success

6. **MsalVersion**  
   The MSAL library version in use.  
   - Example: `"4.51.2"`

7. **Platform**  
   The runtime/OS environment.  
   - Examples: `"net6.0-linux"`, `"net472-windows"`
