# Guidance for SDKs Consuming MSAL

## Overview

To support MSI V2 authentication with the new `/issuecredential` endpoint, the **Azure SDK** will leverage the `IMsalHttpClientFactory` interface and **certificate management APIs** for secure communication with Azure AD using **mutual TLS (mTLS)**.

_This section covers:_
- How Azure SDK uses **`IMsalHttpClientFactory`** for MTLS authentication.
- How SDKs interact with the **certificate APIs** to obtain information about binding certificate.
- The **new `CertificateRefreshed` event**, which notifies when a binding certificate is updated.

---

## **Binding Certificate**

SDKs customizing the httpclient factory will continue to use the old `IMsalHttpClientFactory` interface. MSAL will use the customized httpclient factory to, 

- call into `platformmetadata` endpoint to form the CSR.
- Use the CSR and call into `issuecredential` endpoint to get the Certificate.
- Once. MSAL acquires a certificate, MSAL will will call the mTLS endpoint using this certificate. MSAL will not use the customized factory for this call.
