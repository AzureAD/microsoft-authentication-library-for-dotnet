## 📚 Prompt Categories

### General mTLS Proof of Possession

Use these to understand the fundamentals:

### FIC (Federated Identity Credentials) with mTLS PoP

Use these for token exchange and two-leg flows:

> **Scope note:** FIC over mTLS PoP is supported for **S2S / app (client-credentials)** flows only.

#### Error Handling

```
What do I do if I get "MtlsCertificateNotProvided" error?
```

```
What does "MtlsPopWithoutRegion" error mean?
```

```

```

```
How do I troubleshoot mTLS PoP token acquisition failures?
```

```
What are common errors when using FIC two-leg flow with mTLS PoP?
```

Review this mTLS PoP implementation for correctness and best practices
```

```
Is this FIC two-leg flow implementation correct?
```

```
How do I validate that my mTLS PoP token is properly bound?
```

```
Are there any common pitfalls in FIC two-leg flow I should avoid?
```

## 🎯 Prompt Tips

### ✅ DO This

- **Be specific**: "What is FIC two-leg flow with mTLS PoP?" vs "How does FIC work?"
- **Use skill terms**: "Leg 1", "Leg 2", "TokenBindingCertificate", "assertion"
- **Ask follow-ups**: Copilot remembers context in the same chat
- **Reference errors**: "I'm getting MtlsPopWithoutRegion, what's the solution?"

### ❌ DON'T Do This

- ❌ Generic: "How does FIC work with mTLS pop?" → Use specific prompts instead
- ❌ Vague: "Tell me about mTLS" → Reference specific components
- ❌ Multi-part: Ask one question at a time for best results
- ❌ Off-topic: Keep questions related to MSAL.NET authentication

## 💡 Need Help?

If a prompt isn't returning good results:

1. **Try a more specific version** - Add context like credential type or scenario
2. **Ask a follow-up** - Reference previous answers with "Based on that, how do I..."
3. **Reference code** - Share error messages or code snippets in your question
4. **Break it down** - Ask one aspect at a time instead of multi-part questions

**Pro Tip**: Copilot searches the entire repo including design docs, code, tests, and skills. The more specific you are, the better results you get!
