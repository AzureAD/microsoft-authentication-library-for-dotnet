# Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for .NET

The MSAL library for .NET is part of the [Microsoft identity platform for developers](https://aka.ms/aaddevv2) (formerly named Azure AD) v2.0. It enables you to acquire security tokens to call protected APIs. It uses industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. The library also supports [Azure AD B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory-b2c/).

## Support SLA

MSAL.NET became Generally Available with MSAL.NET 3.0.8. Since MSAL.NET moved to version 4:

- Major versions are supported for twelve months after the release of the next major version.
- Minor versions older than N-1 are not supported.

> **Note**
> Minor versions include bug fixes or features with non-breaking (additive) API changes. It is expected that applications using the library can upgrade through the IDE or CLI with no friction. We will not patch old minor versions of the library. When opening new issues, please confirm that you are using the latest minor version.

## Using MSAL.NET

- Guides, tutorials, and detailed walkthroughs are available [on Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/msal/dotnet/getting-started/choosing-msal-dotnet).
- API documentation is available [on Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client)
- Code samples are available from our [Samples](https://aka.ms/aaddevsamplesv2) page.

## Security library

This library controls how users sign-in and access services. We recommend you always take the latest version of our library in your app when possible. We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) so you can control the risk associated with updating your app. As an example, always downloading the latest minor version number (e.g. x.*y*.z) ensures you get the latest security and feature enhancements but our API surface remains the same. You can always see the latest version and release notes under the Releases tab of GitHub.

## Security reporting

If you find a security issue with our libraries or services please report it to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) in as much detail as possible. Your submission may be eligible for a bounty through the [Microsoft Bug Bounty](https://aka.ms/bugbounty) program. Please do not post security issues to GitHub Issues or any other public site. We will contact you shortly after receiving the information. We encourage you to get notifications of when security incidents occur by visiting the [Microsoft Technical Security Notifications page](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/technical-security-notifications?rtc=1) and subscribing to Security Advisory Alerts.
